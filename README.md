HANGMAN GAME



Welcome to the classic word-guessing game, Hangman! 
This project is a simple implementation of the Hangman game in Python. 
It offers an interactive and entertaining experience where players attempt to guess a secret word letter by letter, 
with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed before a stick figure "hangman" is fully drawn.

INTERACTIVE GAMEPLAY: Players can guess letters and see their progress, while the hangman figure is gradually drawn with each incorrect guess.
ENGAGING EXPERIENCE: The game provides a fun and educational way to improve vocabulary and logical thinking skills.
